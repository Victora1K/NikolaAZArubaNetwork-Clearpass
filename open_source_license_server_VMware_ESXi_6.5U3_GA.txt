SECTION 2.2. THE SOURCE CODE VERSION OF COVERED CODE MAY BE DISTRIBUTED
ONLY UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE OR A FUTURE VERSION OF THIS LICENSE RELEASED UNDER SECTION 6.1, AND YOU MUST INCLUDE A COPY OF THIS LICENSE WITH EVERY COPY OF THE SOURCE CODE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR OTHERWISE MAKE AVAILABLE. YOU MAY NOT OFFER OR IMPOSE ANY TERMS ON ANY SOURCE CODE VERSION THAT ALTERS OR RESTRICTS THE APPLICABLE VERSION OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE RECIPIENTS' RIGHTS HEREUNDER. HOWEVER, YOU MAY INCLUDE AN ADDITIONAL DOCUMENT OFFERING THE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 3.5.
3.2. Availability of Source Code.  ANY MODIFICATION WHICH YOU CREATE OR TO WHICH YOU CONTRIBUTE MUST BE MADE AVAILABLE IN SOURCE CODE FORM UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE
EITHER ON THE SAME MEDIA AS AN EXECUTABLE VERSION OR VIA AN ACCEPTED ELECTRONIC DISTRIBUTION MECHANISM TO ANYONE TO WHOM YOU MADE AN EXECUTABLE VERSION AVAILABLE; AND IF MADE AVAILABLE VIA ELECTRONIC DISTRIBUTION MECHANISM, MUST REMAIN AVAILABLE FOR AT LEAST TWELVE (12) MONTHS AFTER THE DATE IT INITIALLY BECAME AVAILABLE, OR AT LEAST SIX
(6) MONTHS AFTER A SUBSEQUENT VERSION OF THAT PARTICULAR MODIFICATION HAS BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO SUCH RECIPIENTS. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT THE SOURCE CODE VERSION REMAINS AVAILABLE EVEN IF THE ELECTRONIC DISTRIBUTION MECHANISM IS MAINTAINED BY A THIRD PARTY.

ORIGIN OR OWNERSHIP OF THE COVERED CODE.
3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
(a) Third Party Claims   IF CONTRIBUTOR HAS KNOWLEDGE THAT A LICENSE UNDER A THIRD PARTY'S
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IS REQUIRED TO EXERCISE THE RIGHTS GRANTED BY SUCH CONTRIBUTOR UNDER SECTIONS 2.1 OR 2.2, CONTRIBUTOR MUST INCLUDE A TEXT FILE WITH THE SOURCE CODE DISTRIBUTION TITLED "LEGAL" WHICH DESCRIBES THE CLAIM AND THE PARTY MAKING THE CLAIM IN SUFFICIENT DETAIL THAT A RECIPIENT WILL KNOW WHOM TO CONTACT.

COPIES CONTRIBUTOR MAKES AVAILABLE THEREAFTER AND SHALL TAKE OTHER STEPS (SUCH AS NOTIFYING APPROPRIATE MAILING LISTS OR NEWSGROUPS) REASONABLY CALCULATED TO INFORM THOSE WHO RECEIVED THE COVERED CODE THAT NEW KNOWLEDGE HAS BEEN OBTAINED.
(b) Contributor APIs   IF CONTRIBUTOR'S MODIFICATIONS INCLUDE AN APPLICATION PROGRAMMING
INTERFACE AND CONTRIBUTOR HAS KNOWLEDGE OF PATENT LICENSES WHICH ARE REASONABLY NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT THAT API, CONTRIBUTOR MUST ALSO INCLUDE THIS INFORMATION IN THE LEGAL FILE.
(c) Representations.   CONTRIBUTOR REPRESENTS THAT, EXCEPT AS DISCLOSED PURSUANT TO SECTION
3.4 (A) ABOVE, CONTRIBUTOR BELIEVES THAT CONTRIBUTOR'S MODIFICATIONS ARE CONTRIBUTOR'S ORIGINAL CREATION(S) AND/OR CONTRIBUTOR HAS SUFFICIENT RIGHTS TO GRANT THE RIGHTS CONVEYED BY THIS LICENSE.
3.5. Required Notices.  YOU MUST DUPLICATE THE NOTICE IN EXHIBIT A IN EACH FILE OF THE SOURCE
CODE. IF IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PUT SUCH NOTICE IN A PARTICULAR SOURCE CODE FILE DUE TO ITS STRUCTURE, THEN YOU MUST INCLUDE SUCH NOTICE IN A LOCATION (SUCH AS A RELEVANT DIRECTORY) WHERE A USER WOULD BE LIKELY TO LOOK FOR SUCH A NOTICE. IF YOU CREATED ONE OR MORE MODIFICATION(S) YOU MAY ADD YOUR NAME AS A CONTRIBUTOR TO THE NOTICE DESCRIBED IN EXHIBIT A. YOU MUST ALSO DUPLICATE THIS LICENSE IN ANY DOCUMENTATION FOR THE SOURCE CODE WHERE YOU DESCRIBE RECIPIENTS' RIGHTS OR OWNERSHIP RIGHTS RELATING TO COVERED CODE. YOU MAY CHOOSE TO OFFER, AND TO CHARGE A FEE FOR, WARRANTY, SUPPORT, INDEMNITY OR LIABILITY OBLIGATIONS TO ONE OR MORE RECIPIENTS OF COVERED CODE. HOWEVER, YOU MAY DO SO ONLY ON YOUR OWN BEHALF, AND NOT ON BEHALF OF THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR. YOU MUST MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAN ANY SUCH WARRANTY, SUPPORT, INDEMNITY OR LIABILITY OBLIGATION IS OFFERED BY YOU ALONE, AND YOU HEREBY AGREE TO INDEMNIFY THE INITIAL DEVELOPER AND EVERY CONTRIBUTOR FOR ANY LIABILITY INCURRED BY THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR AS A RESULT OF WARRANTY, SUPPORT, INDEMNITY OR LIABILITY TERMS YOU OFFER.
3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.  YOU MAY DISTRIBUTE OR OTHERWISE MAKE AVAILABLE COVERED CODE IN EXECUTABLE FORM ONLY IF THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTIONS 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 AND 3.5 HAVE BEEN MET FOR THAT COVERED CODE, AND IF YOU INCLUDE A NOTICE STATING THAT THE SOURCE CODE VERSION OF THE COVERED CODE IS AVAILABLE UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE, INCLUDING A DESCRIPTION OF HOW AND WHERE YOU HAVE FULFILLED THE OBLIGATIONS OF SECTION 3.2. THE NOTICE MUST BE CONSPICUOUSLY INCLUDED IN ANY NOTICE IN AN EXECUTABLE VERSION, RELATED DOCUMENTATION OR COLLATERAL IN WHICH YOU DESCRIBE RECIPIENTS' RIGHTS RELATING TO THE COVERED CODE. YOU MAY DISTRIBUTE OR OTHERWISE MAKE AVAILABLE THE EXECUTABLE VERSION OF COVERED CODE OR OWNERSHIP RIGHTS UNDER A LICENSE OF YOUR CHOICE, WHICH MAY CONTAIN TERMS DIFFERENT FROM THIS LICENSE, PROVIDED THAT YOU ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE AND THAT THE LICENSE FOR THE EXECUTABLE VERSION DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO LIMIT OR ALTER THE RECIPIENT'S RIGHTS IN THE SOURCE CODE VERSION FROM THE RIGHTS SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE. IF YOU DISTRIBUTE OR OTHERWISE MAKE AVAILABLE THE EXECUTABLE VERSION UNDER A DIFFERENT LICENSE YOU MUST MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT ANY TERMS WHICH DIFFER FROM THIS LICENSE ARE OFFERED BY YOU ALONE, NOT BY THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR. YOU HEREBY AGREE TO INDEMNIFY THE INITIAL DEVELOPER AND EVERY CONTRIBUTOR FOR ANY LIABILITY INCURRED BY THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR AS A RESULT OF ANY SUCH TERMS YOU OFFER.
3.7. Larger Works.  YOU MAY CREATE A LARGER WORK BY COMBINING COVERED CODE WITH OTHER CODE NOT GOVERNED BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE AND DISTRIBUTE OR OTHERWISE MAKE AVAILABLE THE LARGER WORK AS A SINGLE PRODUCT. IN SUCH A CASE, YOU MUST MAKE SURE THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS LICENSE ARE FULFILLED FOR THE COVERED CODE.
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation   IF IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO COMPLY WITH ANY OF THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE WITH RESPECT TO SOME OR ALL OF THE COVERED CODE DUE TO STATUTE, JUDICIAL ORDER, OR REGULATION THEN YOU MUST: (A) COMPLY WITH THE TERMS
OF THIS LICENSE TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE; AND (B) DESCRIBE THE LIMITATIONS AND THE CODE THEY AFFECT. SUCH DESCRIPTION MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE LEGAL FILE DESCRIBED IN SECTION 3.4 AND MUST BE INCLUDED WITH ALL DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE SOURCE CODE. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY STATUTE OR REGULATION, SUCH DESCRIPTION MUST BE SUFFICIENTLY DETAILED FOR A RECIPIENT OF ORDINARY SKILL TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT.
5. Application of this License   THIS LICENSE APPLIES TO CODE TO WHICH THE INITIAL DEVELOPER HAS
ATTACHED THE NOTICE IN EXHIBIT A AND TO RELATED COVERED CODE.
6. Versions of the License
6.1. New Versions   TERRACOTTA, INC. ("TERRACOTTA") MAY PUBLISH REVISED AND/OR NEW VERSIONS
OF THE LICENSE FROM TIME TO TIME. EACH VERSION WILL BE GIVEN A DISTINGUISHING VERSION NUMBER.
6.2. Effect of New Versions  ONCE COVERED CODE HAS BEEN PUBLISHED UNDER A PARTICULAR VERSION OF THE LICENSE, YOU MAY ALWAYS CONTINUE TO USE IT UNDER THE TERMS OF THAT
VERSION. YOU MAY ALSO CHOOSE TO USE SUCH COVERED CODE UNDER THE TERMS OF ANY SUBSEQUENT VERSION OF THE LICENSE PUBLISHED BY TERRACOTTA. NO ONE OTHER THAN TERRACOTTA HAS THE RIGHT TO MODIFY THE TERMS APPLICABLE TO COVERED CODE CREATED UNDER THIS LICENSE.
6.3. Derivative Works of License; Antecedent Licenses   IF YOU CREATE OR USE A MODIFIED VERSION OF THIS LICENSE (WHICH YOU MAY ONLY DO IN ORDER TO APPLY IT TO CODE WHICH IS NOT ALREADY COVERED CODE GOVERNED BY THIS LICENSE), YOU MUST (A) RENAME YOUR LICENSE SO THAT THE
PHRASES "TERRACOTTA", "TPL", OR ANY CONFUSINGLY SIMILAR PHRASE DO NOT APPEAR IN YOUR LICENSE (EXCEPT TO NOTE THAT YOUR LICENSE DIFFERS FROM THIS LICENSE) AND (B) OTHERWISE MAKE IT CLEAR THAT YOUR VERSION OF THE LICENSE CONTAINS TERMS WHICH DIFFER FROM THE TERRACOTTA PUBLIC LICENSE.  (FILLING IN THE NAME OF THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ORIGINAL CODE OR
CONTRIBUTOR IN THE NOTICE DESCRIBED IN EXHIBIT A SHALL NOT OF THEMSELVES BE DEEMED TO BE MODIFICATIONS OF THIS LICENSE.)

THIS TERRACOTTA PUBLIC LICENSE (TPL) IS SIMILAR TO, AND CONTAINS SAMPLES FROM, THE MOZILLA PUBLIC LICENSE (MPL) AND THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL).  HOWEVER, THIS TPL CONTAINS TERMS WHICH DIFFER FROM THOSE CONTAINED IN THE MPL AND THE
CDDL.
7. Disclaimer of warranty   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
8. Termination
8.1. THIS LICENSE AND THE RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER WILL TERMINATE AUTOMATICALLY IF YOU FAIL TO COMPLY WITH TERMS HEREIN AND FAIL TO CURE SUCH BREACH WITHIN 30 DAYS OF BECOMING AWARE OF THE BREACH. ALL SUBLICENSES TO THE COVERED CODE WHICH ARE PROPERLY GRANTED SHALL SURVIVE ANY TERMINATION OF THIS LICENSE. PROVISIONS WHICH, BY THEIR NATURE, MUST REMAIN IN EFFECT BEYOND THE TERMINATION OF THIS LICENSE SHALL SURVIVE.
8.2. IF YOU INITIATE LITIGATION BY ASSERTING A PATENT INFRINGEMENT CLAIM (EXCLUDING DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACTIONS) AGAINST INITIAL DEVELOPER OR A CONTRIBUTOR (THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR CONTRIBUTOR AGAINST WHOM YOU FILE SUCH ACTION IS REFERRED TO AS "PARTICIPANT") ALLEGING THAT:
     a. such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.
     b. any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.
8.3. IF YOU ASSERT A PATENT INFRINGEMENT CLAIM AGAINST PARTICIPANT ALLEGING THAT SUCH PARTICIPANT'S CONTRIBUTOR VERSION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY INFRINGES ANY PATENT WHERE SUCH CLAIM IS RESOLVED (SUCH AS BY LICENSE OR SETTLEMENT) PRIOR TO THE INITIATION OF PATENT
INFRINGEMENT LITIGATION, THEN THE REASONABLE VALUE OF THE LICENSES GRANTED BY SUCH PARTICIPANT UNDER SECTIONS 2.1 OR 2.2 SHALL BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OR VALUE OF ANY PAYMENT OR LICENSE.
8.4. IN THE EVENT OF TERMINATION UNDER SECTIONS 8.1 OR 8.2 ABOVE, ALL END USER LICENSE AGREEMENTS (EXCLUDING DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS) WHICH HAVE BEEN VALIDLY GRANTED BY YOU OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR HEREUNDER PRIOR TO TERMINATION SHALL SURVIVE TERMINATION.
9. Limitation of liability   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS
OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
10. U.S. government end users  THE COVERED CODE IS A "COMMERCIAL ITEM," AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED IN 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (OCT. 1995), CONSISTING OF "COMMERCIAL COMPUTER SOFTWARE" AND "COMMERCIAL COMPUTER SOFTWARE DOCUMENTATION," AS SUCH TERMS ARE USED IN 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (SEPT. 1995). CONSISTENT WITH 48 C.F.R. 12.212 AND 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 THROUGH 227.7202-4 (JUNE 1995), ALL U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS ACQUIRE COVERED CODE WITH ONLY THOSE RIGHTS SET FORTH HEREIN.
11. Miscellaneous  THIS LICENSE REPRESENTS THE COMPLETE AGREEMENT CONCERNING SUBJECT

This code is in the public domain and has no copyright.

This is a plain C recursive-descent translation of an old
public-domain YACC grammar that has been used for parsing dates in
very many open-source projects.

Since the original authors were generous enough to donate their
work to the public domain, I feel compelled to match their
generosity.

>>> md5 algorithm implementation-none

This code implements the MD5 message-digest algorithm.
The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest.  This code was
written by Colin Plumb in 1993, no copyright is claimed.
This code is in the public domain; do with it what you wish.

Equivalent code is available from RSA Data Security, Inc.
This code has been tested against that, and is equivalent,
except that you don't need to include two pages of legalese
with every copy.

To compute the message digest of a chunk of bytes, declare an
MD5Context structure, pass it to MD5Init, call MD5Update as
needed on buffers full of bytes, and then call MD5Final, which
will fill a supplied 16-byte array with the digest.

*****[VMWARE DOES NOT DISTRIBUTE THE SUB-COMPONENTS "ARB_texture_float extension"]*****


Silicon Graphics, Inc. owns US Patent #6,650,327, issued November 18,
2003 [1].

SGI believes this patent contains necessary IP for graphics systems
implementing floating point rasterization and floating point
framebuffer capabilities described in ARB_texture_float extension, and
will discuss licensing on RAND terms, on an individual basis with
companies wishing to use this IP in the context of conformant OpenGL
implementations [2].

The source code to implement ARB_texture_float extension is included
and can be toggled on at compile time, for those who purchased a
license from SGI, or are in a country where the patent does not apply,
etc.

The software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express
or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement.
In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any
claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract,
tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the
software or the use or other dealings in the software.

You should contact a lawyer or SGI's legal department if you want to
enable this extension.

ntp-4.2.8p12.tar-2.gz\ntp-4.2.8p12.tar-2\ntp-4.2.8p12\lib\isc\include\isc\md5.h

The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest.  This code was
written by Colin Plumb in 1993, no copyright is claimed.
This code is in the public domain; do with it what you wish.

Equivalent code is available from RSA Data Security, Inc.
This code has been tested against that, and is equivalent,
except that you don't need to include two pages of legalese
with every copy.

To compute the message digest of a chunk of bytes, declare an
MD5Context structure, pass it to MD5Init, call MD5Update as
needed on buffers full of bytes, and then call MD5Final, which
will fill a supplied 16-byte array with the digest.

Changed so as no longer to depend on Colin Plumb's `usual.h'
header definitions; now uses stuff from dpkg's config.h
- Ian Jackson <ijackson@nyx.cs.du.edu>.
Still in the public domain.

This file is part of the OpenSSH software.

The licences which components of this software fall under are as
follows.  First, we will summarize and say that all components
are under a BSD licence, or a licence more free than that.

OpenSSH contains no GPL code.

1)
 Copyright (c) 1995 Tatu Ylonen <ylo@cs.hut.fi>, Espoo, Finland
                    All rights reserved

 As far as I am concerned, the code I have written for this software
 can be used freely for any purpose.  Any derived versions of this
 software must be clearly marked as such, and if the derived work is
 incompatible with the protocol description in the RFC file, it must be
 called by a name other than "ssh" or "Secure Shell".

[Tatu continues]
  However, I am not implying to give any licenses to any patents or
 copyrights held by third parties, and the software includes parts that
 are not under my direct control.  As far as I know, all included
 source code is used in accordance with the relevant license agreements
 and can be used freely for any purpose (the GNU license being the most
 restrictive); see below for details.

[However, none of that term is relevant at this point in time.  All of
these restrictively licenced software components which he talks about
have been removed from OpenSSH, i.e.,

- RSA is no longer included, found in the OpenSSL library
- IDEA is no longer included, its use is deprecated
- DES is now external, in the OpenSSL library
- GMP is no longer used, and instead we call BN code from OpenSSL
- Zlib is now external, in a library
- The make-ssh-known-hosts script is no longer included
- TSS has been removed
- MD5 is now external, in the OpenSSL library
- RC4 support has been replaced with ARC4 support from OpenSSL
- Blowfish is now external, in the OpenSSL library

[The licence continues]

Note that any information and cryptographic algorithms used in this
software are publicly available on the Internet and at any major
bookstore, scientific library, and patent office worldwide.  More
information can be found e.g. at "http://www.cs.hut.fi/crypto".

The legal status of this program is some combination of all these
permissions and restrictions.  Use only at your own responsibility.
You will be responsible for any legal consequences yourself; I am not
making any claims whether possessing or using this is legal or not in
your country, and I am not taking any responsibility on your behalf.


NO WARRANTY

BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

This file is part of the OpenSSH software.

The licences which components of this software fall under are as
follows.  First, we will summarize and say that all components
are under a BSD licence, or a licence more free than that.

OpenSSH contains no GPL code.

1)
Copyright (c) 1995 Tatu Ylonen <ylo@cs.hut.fi>, Espoo, Finland
All rights reserved

As far as I am concerned, the code I have written for this software
can be used freely for any purpose.  Any derived versions of this
software must be clearly marked as such, and if the derived work is
incompatible with the protocol description in the RFC file, it must be
called by a name other than "ssh" or "Secure Shell".

[Tatu continues]
However, I am not implying to give any licenses to any patents or
copyrights held by third parties, and the software includes parts that
are not under my direct control.  As far as I know, all included
source code is used in accordance with the relevant license agreements
and can be used freely for any purpose (the GNU license being the most
restrictive); see below for details.

[However, none of that term is relevant at this point in time.  All of
these restrictively licenced software components which he talks about
have been removed from OpenSSH, i.e.,

- RSA is no longer included, found in the OpenSSL library
- IDEA is no longer included, its use is deprecated
- DES is now external, in the OpenSSL library
- GMP is no longer used, and instead we call BN code from OpenSSL
- Zlib is now external, in a library
- The make-ssh-known-hosts script is no longer included
- TSS has been removed
- MD5 is now external, in the OpenSSL library
- RC4 support has been replaced with ARC4 support from OpenSSL
- Blowfish is now external, in the OpenSSL library

[The licence continues]

Note that any information and cryptographic algorithms used in this
software are publicly available on the Internet and at any major
bookstore, scientific library, and patent office worldwide.  More
information can be found e.g. at "http://www.cs.hut.fi/crypto".

The legal status of this program is some combination of all these
permissions and restrictions.  Use only at your own responsibility.
You will be responsible for any legal consequences yourself; I am not
making any claims whether possessing or using this is legal or not in
your country, and I am not taking any responsibility on your behalf.


NO WARRANTY

BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Copyright 1999 by Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org>

Needs to be called before any other auth modules so we can setup the
user prompt before it's first used. Allows one argument option, which
is the full path to a file to be used for issue (uses /etc/issue as a
default) such as "issue=/etc/issue.telnet".

We can also parse escapes within the the issue file (enabled by
default, but can be disabled with the "noesc" option). It's the exact
same parsing as util-linux's agetty program performs.

argv_parse.c --- utility function for parsing a string into a
argc, argv array.

This file defines a function argv_parse() which parsing a
passed-in string, handling double quotes and backslashes, and
creates an allocated argv vector which can be freed using the
argv_free() function.

See argv_parse.h for the formal definition of the functions.

This code implements the MD5 message-digest algorithm.
The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest.  This code was
written by Colin Plumb in 1993, no copyright is claimed.
This code is in the public domain; do with it what you wish.

Equivalent code is available from RSA Data Security, Inc.
This code has been tested against that, and is equivalent,
except that you don't need to include two pages of legalese
with every copy.

To compute the message digest of a chunk of bytes, declare an
MD5Context structure, pass it to MD5Init, call MD5Update as
needed on buffers full of bytes, and then call MD5Final, which
will fill a supplied 16-byte array with the digest.

lcc is not public-domain software, shareware, and it is not protected
by a `copyleft' agreement, like the code from the Free Software
Foundation.

lcc is available free for your personal research and instructional use
under the `fair use' provisions of the copyright law. You may, however,
redistribute lcc in whole or in part provided you acknowledge its
source and include this CPYRIGHT file. You may, for example, include
the distribution in a CDROM of free software, provided you charge only
for the media, or mirror the distribution files at your site.

You may not sell lcc or any product derived from it in which it is a
significant part of the value of the product. Using the lcc front end
to build a C syntax checker is an example of this kind of product.

You may use parts of lcc in products as long as you charge for only
those components that are entirely your own and you acknowledge the use
of lcc clearly in all product documentation and distribution media. You
must state clearly that your product uses or is based on parts of lcc
and that lcc is available free of charge. You must also request that
bug reports on your product be reported to you. Using the lcc front
end to build a C compiler for the Motorola 88000 chip and charging for
and distributing only the 88000 code generator is an example of this
kind of product.

Using parts of lcc in other products is more problematic. For example,
using parts of lcc in a C++ compiler could save substantial time and
effort and therefore contribute significantly to the profitability of
the product. This kind of use, or any use where others stand to make a
profit from what is primarily our work, requires a license agreement
with Addison-Wesley.  Per-copy and unlimited use licenses are
available; for more information, contact

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================
Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
from                                compatible? (1)

0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes
1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no
2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no
1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)
2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no
2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

CNRI LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR PYTHON 1.6.1
---------------------------------------
1. This LICENSE AGREEMENT is between the Corporation for National
Research Initiatives, having an office at 1895 Preston White Drive,
Reston, VA 20191 ("CNRI"), and the Individual or Organization
("Licensee") accessing and otherwise using Python 1.6.1 software in
source or binary form and its associated documentation.

2. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, CNRI
hereby grants Licensee a nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide
license to reproduce, analyze, test, perform and/or display publicly,
prepare derivative works, distribute, and otherwise use Python 1.6.1
alone or in any derivative version, provided, however, that CNRI's
License Agreement and CNRI's notice of copyright, i.e., "Copyright (c)
1995-2001 Corporation for National Research Initiatives; All Rights
Reserved" are retained in Python 1.6.1 alone or in any derivative
version prepared by Licensee.  Alternately, in lieu of CNRI's License
Agreement, Licensee may substitute the following text (omitting the
quotes): "Python 1.6.1 is made available subject to the terms and
conditions in CNRI's License Agreement.  This Agreement together with
Python 1.6.1 may be located on the Internet using the following
unique, persistent identifier (known as a handle): 1895.22/1013.  This
Agreement may also be obtained from a proxy server on the Internet
using the following URL: http://hdl.handle.net/1895.22/1013".

3. In the event Licensee prepares a derivative work that is based on
or incorporates Python 1.6.1 or any part thereof, and wants to make
the derivative work available to others as provided herein, then
Licensee hereby agrees to include in any such work a brief summary of
the changes made to Python 1.6.1.

4. CNRI is making Python 1.6.1 available to Licensee on an "AS IS"
basis.  CNRI MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED.  BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, BUT NOT LIMITATION, CNRI MAKES NO AND
DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR THAT THE USE OF PYTHON 1.6.1 WILL NOT
INFRINGE ANY THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.

5. CNRI SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY OTHER USERS OF PYTHON
1.6.1 FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSS AS
A RESULT OF MODIFYING, DISTRIBUTING, OR OTHERWISE USING PYTHON 1.6.1,
OR ANY DERIVATIVE THEREOF, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.

6. This License Agreement will automatically terminate upon a material
breach of its terms and conditions.

7. This License Agreement shall be governed by the federal
intellectual property law of the United States, including without
limitation the federal copyright law, and, to the extent such
U.S. federal law does not apply, by the law of the Commonwealth of
Virginia, excluding Virginia's conflict of law provisions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with regard to derivative works based
on Python 1.6.1 that incorporate non-separable material that was
previously distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), the
law of the Commonwealth of Virginia shall govern this License
Agreement only as to issues arising under or with respect to
Paragraphs 4, 5, and 7 of this License Agreement.  Nothing in this
License Agreement shall be deemed to create any relationship of
agency, partnership, or joint venture between CNRI and Licensee.  This
License Agreement does not grant permission to use CNRI trademarks or
trade name in a trademark sense to endorse or promote products or
services of Licensee, or any third party.

8. By clicking on the "ACCEPT" button where indicated, or by copying,
installing or otherwise using Python 1.6.1, Licensee agrees to be
bound by the terms and conditions of this License Agreement.

 File System Wrapper License
=============================

The various parts of the File System Wrapper source code come from
different sources and may carry different licenses. Here's a quick
account of the situation:

 * The core code was written from scratch and is covered by a
   BSD-style license.

 * The EFI host driver was written from scratch, possibly using code
   from the TianoCore project and Intel's EFI Application Toolkit. It
   is covered by a BSD-style license.

 * The ext2 and reiserfs file system drivers use definitions from the
   Linux kernel source. The actual code was written from scratch,
   using multiple sources for reference. These drivers are covered by
   the GNU GPL.

For more details, see each file's boilerplate comment. The full text
of the GNU GPL is in the file LICENSE_GPL.txt.

SQLite Copyright

SQLite is in the Public Domain

All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been dedicated to the public domain by the authors. All code authors, and representatives of the companies they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to the public domain and originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe at the main offices of Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.

The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code in SQLite - those parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and ship with a larger application. Portions of the documentation and some code used as part of the build process might fall under other licenses. The details here are unclear. We do not worry about the licensing of the documentation and build code so much because none of these things are part of the core deliverable SQLite library.

All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No code has been taken from other projects or from the open internet. Every line of code can be traced back to its original author, and all of those authors have public domain dedications on file. So the SQLite code base is clean and is uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.

Licensing of XZ Embedded
========================

All the files in this package have been written by Lasse Collin
and/or Igor Pavlov. All these files have been put into the
public domain. You can do whatever you want with these files.

As usual, this software is provided "as is", without any warranty.

XZ Utils Licensing
==================

    Different licenses apply to different files in this package. Here
    is a rough summary of which licenses apply to which parts of this
    package (but check the individual files to be sure!):

      - liblzma is in the public domain.

      - xz, xzdec, and lzmadec command line tools are in the public
        domain unless GNU getopt_long had to be compiled and linked
        in from the lib directory. The getopt_long code is under
        GNU LGPLv2.1+.

      - The scripts to grep, diff, and view compressed files have been
        adapted from gzip. These scripts and their documentation are
        under GNU GPLv2+.

      - All the documentation in the doc directory and most of the
        XZ Utils specific documentation files in other directories
        are in the public domain.

      - Translated messages are in the public domain.

      - The build system contains public domain files, and files that
        are under GNU GPLv2+ or GNU GPLv3+. None of these files end up
        in the binaries being built.

      - Test files and test code in the tests directory, and debugging
        utilities in the debug directory are in the public domain.

      - The extra directory may contain public domain files, and files
        that are under various free software licenses.

    You can do whatever you want with the files that have been put into
    the public domain. If you find public domain legally problematic,
    take the previous sentence as a license grant. If you still find
    the lack of copyright legally problematic, you have too many
    lawyers.

    As usual, this software is provided "as is", without any warranty.

    If you copy significant amounts of public domain code from XZ Utils
    into your project, acknowledging this somewhere in your software is
    polite (especially if it is proprietary, non-free software), but
    naturally it is not legally required. Here is an example of a good
    notice to put into "about box" or into documentation:

        This software includes code from XZ Utils <http://tukaani.org/xz/>.

    The following license texts are included in the following files:
      - COPYING.LGPLv2.1: GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1
      - COPYING.GPLv2: GNU General Public License version 2
      - COPYING.GPLv3: GNU General Public License version 3

    Note that the toolchain (compiler, linker etc.) may add some code
    pieces that are copyrighted. Thus, it is possible that e.g. liblzma
    binary wouldn't actually be in the public domain in its entirety
    even though it contains no copyrighted code from the XZ Utils source
    package.

    If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask the author(s) for more
    information.

Documentation
 
Publically available from Intel web site. Errata documentation 
is also publically available. As an aide to anyone hacking on this 
driver the list of errata that are relevant is below.going back to 
PIIX4. Older device documentation is now a bit tricky to find. 
 
The chipsets all follow very much the same design. The orginal Triton 
series chipsets do _not_ support independant device timings, but this 
is fixed in Triton II. With the odd mobile exception the chips then 
change little except in gaining more modes until SATA arrives. This 
driver supports only the chips with independant timing (that is those 
with SITRE and the 0x44 timing register). See pata_oldpiix and pata_mpiix 
for the early chip drivers.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to 
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended
to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure 
the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies 
to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program 
whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation 
software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You 
can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom 
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you 
wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you 
can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that 
you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to 
deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These 
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or 
for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You 
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you 
must show them these terms so they know their rights.
 
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) 
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute 
and/or modify the software. 

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that 
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If 
the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its 
recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any 
problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' 
reputations. 

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We 
wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will 
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program 
proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be 
licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. 

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification 
follow. 

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
   placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the 
   terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any
   such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the 
   Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a 
   work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with 
   modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, 
   translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) 
   Each licensee is addressed as "you". 

   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not 
   covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running 
   the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered 
   only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent 
   of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends
   on what the Program does. 

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code 
   as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and 
   appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and 
   disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this 
   License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients 
   of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. 

   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you 
   may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, 
   thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such 
   modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that 
   you also meet all of these conditions: 

   * a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating 
        that you changed the files and the date of any change. 

   * b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in 
        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part 
        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
        under the terms of this License. 

   * c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when 
        run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive 
        use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement 
        including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is
        no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that 
        users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and 
        telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if 
        the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such 
        an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to 
        print an announcement.) 

   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable 
   sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be 
   reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then 
   this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you 
   distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same 
   sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the 
   distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose 
   permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to 
   each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 

   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest 
   your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to 
   exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or 
   collective works based on the Program. 

   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program 
   with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a 
   storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the 
   scope of this License. 

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under 
   Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 
   1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 

   * a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
        code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 
        above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 

   * b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, 
        to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of 
        physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-
        readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed 
        under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily 
        used for software interchange; or, 

   * c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to 
        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed 
        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the 
        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in 
        accord with Subsection b above.) 

   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for 
   making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code 
   means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any 
   associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control 
   compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special 
   exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is 
   normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major 
   components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which
   the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the 
   executable. 

   If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access 
   to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy 
   the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source 
   code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source 
   along with the object code. 

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
   expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, 
   modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will 
   automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties 
   who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not
   have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full 
   compliance. 

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed 
   it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute 
   the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law 
   if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or 
   distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you 
   indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and
   conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works 
   based on it. 

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the 
   Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the 
   original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to 
   these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions 
   on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not 
   responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. 

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
   infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not 
   excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute 
   so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and 
   any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not 
   distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would 
   not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who 
   receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you 
   could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from 
   distribution of the Program. 

   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
   particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply
   and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. 

   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any 
   patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any 
   such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the 
   integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented 
   by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions
   to the wide range of software distributed through that system in 
   reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the 
   author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software 
   through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. 

   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be 
   a consequence of the rest of this License. 

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain 
   countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original 
   copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an 
   explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, 
   so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus 
   excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if 
   written in the body of this License. 

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of 
   the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be 
   similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to 
   address new problems or concerns. 

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program 
   specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any 
   later version", you have the option of following the terms and 
   conditions either of that version or of any later version published by 
   the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version 
   number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the 
   Free Software Foundation. 

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
    whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask 
    for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software 
    Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make 
    exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of 
    preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and 
    of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. 

   NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY 
    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN 
    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES 
    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER 
    EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED 
    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE 
    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH 
    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL 
    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING 
    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR 
    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR 
    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM 
    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED 
    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF 
    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR 
    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

This driver is based on the 'USB Mass Storage Class' document. This 
describes in detail the protocol used to communicate with such 
devices. Clearly, the designers had SCSI and ATAPI commands in 
mind when they created this document. The commands are all very 
similar to commands in the SCSI-II and ATAPI specifications. 
 
It is important to note that in a number of cases this class 
exhibits class-specific exemptions from the USB specification. 
Notably the usage of NAK, STALL and ACK differs from the norm, in 
that they are used to communicate wait, failed and OK on commands. 
 
Also, for certain devices, the interrupt endpoint is used to convey 
status of a command. 
 
Please see http://www.one-eyed-alien.net/~mdharm/linux-usb for more 
information about this driver.

The bison generated parser uses alloca.  AIX 3 forces us to put this
declaration at the beginning of the file.  The declaration in bison's

because <config.h> may include arbitrary system headers.

of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership

of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii)

beneficial ownership of such entity.



"You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising

permissions granted by this License.  



"Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,

including but not limited to software source code, documentation source,

and configuration files.



"Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation

or translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled

object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media

types.  



"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or

Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright

notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided

in the Appendix below).  



"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form,

that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial

revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent,

as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this

License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable

from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work

and Derivative Works thereof.



"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the

original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to

electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its

representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic

discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is

conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright

owner as "Not a Contribution."



"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

subsequently incorporated within the Work.



2. Grant of Copyright License.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor

hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,

royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare

Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and

distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.



3. Grant of Patent License.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor

hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,

royalty- free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent

license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and

otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those

patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily

infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of

their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s)

was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity

(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the

Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct

or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted

to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date

such litigation is filed.



4. Redistribution.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works

thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or

Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:



  a. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works

     a copy of this License; and



  b. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating

     that You changed the files; and



  c. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that

     You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution

     notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices

     that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and



  d. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its

     distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

     include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained

     within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not

     pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of

     the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part

     of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation,

     if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display

     You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text

     from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices

     cannot be construed as modifying the License.  You may add Your own

     copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional

     or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or

     distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works

     as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the

     Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.



5. Submission of Contributions.

Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally

submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be

under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional

terms or conditions.  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall

supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may

have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.



6. Trademarks.

This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,

service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for

reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and

reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.



7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor

provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on

an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either

express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or

conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR

A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks

associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.



8. Limitation of Liability.

In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including

negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law

(such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing,

shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct,

indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character

arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to

use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,

work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other

commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised

of the possibility of such damages.



9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may

choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,

indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with

this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only

on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of

any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and

hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims

asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such

warranty or additional liability.

3. Distribution Obligations.

3.1. Availability of Source Code.

Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available
in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and
that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this
License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the
Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make
available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in
Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source
Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used
for software exchange.

3.2. Modifications.

The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed
by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your
Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient
rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

3.3. Required Notices.

You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies
You as the Contributor of the Modification.  You may not remove or alter
any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered
Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving
attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.

3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source
Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License
or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to
charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to
one or more recipients of Covered Software.  However, you may do so only
on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and
You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor
as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the
terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice,
which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are
in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights
in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If
You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different
license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer
or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer
or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

3.6. Larger Works.

You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code
not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work
as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements
of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.

4. Versions of the License. 

4.1. New Versions.

Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish
revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each
version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided
in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to
modify this License.

4.2. Effect of New Versions.

You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
Software available under the terms of the version of the License under
which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial
Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it
from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent
version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software
available under the terms of the version of the License under which You
originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose
to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available
under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
the license steward.

4.3. Modified Versions.

When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license
for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of
this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references
to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license
differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the
license contains terms which differ from this License.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF
DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST
OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY
COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

6. TERMINATION. 

6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions
which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of
this License shall survive.

6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the
Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is
referred to as "Participant") alleging that the Participant Software
(meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor
or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer)
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights
granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial
Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all
Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60
days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically
at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such
60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant
Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a
written agreement with Participant.

6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end
user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor
hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by
any distributor) shall survive termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER
OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,
COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES
OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY
FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO
THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS
DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined
in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. ¤ 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and
"commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in
48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.  1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48
C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End
Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.
This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any
other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government
rights in computer software under this License.

9. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable,
such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction
specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to
the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such
jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to
this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located
in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within
the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs,
including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys'
fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any
law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall
be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and
regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise
make available any Covered Software.

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out
of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work
with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility
on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to
constitute any admission of liability.



--------------- SECTION 3: Eclipse Public License, V1.0 -----------

Eclipse Public License - v 1.0

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
    documentation distributed under this Agreement, and

    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

        i) changes to the Program, and

        ii) additions to the Program; where such changes and/or
        additions to the Program originate from and are distributed
        by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates'
        from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such
        Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's
        behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program
        which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
        conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement,
        and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
or when combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
    license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
    publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
    Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and
    object code form.

    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
    license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
    import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
    if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license
    shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program
    if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
    addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered
    by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
    other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per
    se is licensed hereunder.

    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
    licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
    provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
    patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
    Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
    any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights
    or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
    granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility
    to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For
    example, if a third party patent license is required to allow
    Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility
    to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
    copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
    license set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form
under its own license agreement, provided that:

    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

    b) its license agreement:

        i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
        warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
        warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
        implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
        for a particular purpose;

        ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
        liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
        incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

        iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement
        are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other
        party; and

        iv) states that source code for the Program is available from
        such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a
        reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for
        software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
    the Program.  Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright
    notices contained within the Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the
Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering
should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for
other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a
commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor")
hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor
("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs
(collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to
the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor
in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial
product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any
claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)
promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim,
and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with
the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims,
or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and
warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under
this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims
against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and
warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any
damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED
ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR
CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining
the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes
all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement
, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or
equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION
OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action
by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including
a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails
to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement
and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after
becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under
this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution
of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's
obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient
relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may
only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves
the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement
from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right
to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement
Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve
as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version
of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The
Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to
the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,
after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect
to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new
version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above,
Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of
any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to
this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than
one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights
to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.



--------------- SECTION 4: GNU General Public License, V2.0 -----------

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.



--------------- SECTION 5: GNU General Public License, V3.0 -----------

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

                       Version 3, 29 June 2007



 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies

 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.



                            Preamble



  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for

software and other kinds of works.



  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed

to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,

the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to

share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free

software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the

GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to

any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to

your programs, too.



  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not

price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you

have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for

them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you

want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new

free programs, and that you know you can do these things.



  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you

these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have

certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if

you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.



  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether

gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same

freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive

or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they

know their rights.



  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:

(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License

giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.



  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains

that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and

authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as

changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to

authors of previous versions.



  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run

modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer

can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of

protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic

pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to

use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we

have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those

products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we

stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions

of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.



  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.

States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of

software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to

avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could

make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that

patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.



  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and

modification follow.



                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS



  0. Definitions.



  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.



  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of

works, such as semiconductor masks.



  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this

License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and

"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.



  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work

in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an

exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the

earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.



  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based

on the Program.



  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without

permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for

infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a

computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,

distribution (with or without modification), making available to the

public, and in some countries other activities as well.



  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other

parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through

a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.



  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"

to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible

feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)

tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the

extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the

work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If

the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a

menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.



  1. Source Code.



  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work

for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source

form of a work.



  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official

standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of

interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that

is widely used among developers working in that language.



  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other

than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of

packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major

Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that

Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an

implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A

"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component

(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system

(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to

produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.



  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all

the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable

work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to

control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's

System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free

programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but

which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source

includes interface definition files associated with source files for

the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically

linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,

such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those

subprograms and other parts of the work.



  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users

can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding

Source.



  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that

same work.



  2. Basic Permissions.



  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of

copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated

conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited

permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a

covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its

content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your

rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.



  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not

convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains

in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose

of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you

with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with

the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do

not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works

for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction

and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of

your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.



  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under

the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10

makes it unnecessary.



  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.



  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological

measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article

11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or

similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such

measures.



  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid

circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention

is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to

the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or

modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's

users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of

technological measures.



  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.



  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you

receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and

appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;

keep intact all notices stating that this License and any

non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;

keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all

recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.



  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,

and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.



  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.



  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to

produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the

terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:



    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified

    it, and giving a relevant date.



    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is

    released under this License and any conditions added under section

    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to

    "keep intact all notices".



    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this

    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This

    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7

    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,

    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no

    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not

    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.



    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display

    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive

    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your

    work need not make them do so.



  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent

works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,

and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,

in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an

"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not

used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users

beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work

in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other

parts of the aggregate.



  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.



  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms

of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the

machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,

in one of these ways:



    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product

    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the

    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium

    customarily used for software interchange.



    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product

    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a

    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as

    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product

    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a

    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the

    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical

    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no

    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this

    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the

    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.



    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the

    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This

    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and

    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord

    with subsection 6b.



    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated

    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the

    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no

    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the

    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to

    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source

    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)

    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain

    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the

    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the

    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is

    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.



    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided

    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding

    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no

    charge under subsection 6d.



  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded

from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be

included in conveying the object code work.



  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any

tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,

or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation

into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,

doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular

product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a

typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status

of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user

actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product

is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial

commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent

the only significant mode of use of the product.



  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,

procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install

and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from

a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must

suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object

code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because

modification has been made.



  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or

specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as

part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the

User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a

fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the

Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied

by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply

if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install

modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has

been installed in ROM).



  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a

requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates

for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for

the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a

network may be denied when the modification itself materially and

adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and

protocols for communication across the network.



  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,

in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly

documented (and with an implementation available to the public in

source code form), and must require no special password or key for

unpacking, reading or copying.



  7. Additional Terms.



  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this

License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.

Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall

be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent

that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions

apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately

under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by

this License without regard to the additional permissions.



  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option

remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of

it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own

removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place

additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,

for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.



  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you

add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of

that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:



    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the

    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or



    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or

    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal

    Notices displayed by works containing it; or



    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or

    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in

    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or



    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or

    authors of the material; or



    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some

    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or



    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that

    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of

    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for

    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on

    those licensors and authors.



  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further

restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you

received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is

governed by this License along with a term that is a further

restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains

a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this

License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms

of that license document, provided that the further restriction does

not survive such relicensing or conveying.



  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you

must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the

additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating

where to find the applicable terms.



  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the

form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;

the above requirements apply either way.



  8. Termination.



  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly

provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or

modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under

this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third

paragraph of section 11).



  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your

license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)

provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and

finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright

holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means

prior to 60 days after the cessation.



  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is

reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the

violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have

received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that

copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after

your receipt of the notice.



  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the

licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under

this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently

reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same

material under section 10.



  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.



  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or

run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work

occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission

to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,

nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or

modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do

not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a

covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.



  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.



  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically

receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and

propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible

for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.



  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an

organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an

organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered

work results from an entity transaction, each party to that

transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever

licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could

give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the

Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if

the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.



  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the

rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may

not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of

rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation

(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that

any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for

sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.



  11. Patents.



  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this

License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The

work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".



  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims

owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or

hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted

by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,

but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a

consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For

purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant

patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of

this License.



  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free

patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to

make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and

propagate the contents of its contributor version.



  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express

agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent

(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to

sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a

party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a

patent against the party.



  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,

and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone

to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a

publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,

then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so

available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the

patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner

consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent

license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have

actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the

covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work

in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that

country that you have reason to believe are valid.



  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or

arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a

covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties

receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify

or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license

you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered

work and works based on it.



  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within

the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is

conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are

specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered

work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is

in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment

to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying

the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the

parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory

patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work

conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily

for and in connection with specific products or compilations that

contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,

or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.



  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting

any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may

otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.



  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.



  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or

otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not

excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a

covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this

License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may

not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you

to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey

the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this

License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.



  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.



  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have

permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed

under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single

combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this

License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,

but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,

section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the

combination as such.



  14. Revised Versions of this License.



  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of

the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will

be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to

address new problems or concerns.



  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the

Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General

Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the

option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered

version or of any later version published by the Free Software

Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the

GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published

by the Free Software Foundation.



  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future

versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's

public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you

to choose that version for the Program.



  Later license versions may give you additional or different

permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any

author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a

later version.



  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.



  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY

APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT

HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY

OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,

THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR

PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM

IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF

ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.



  16. Limitation of Liability.



  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING

WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS

THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY

GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE

USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF

DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD

PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),

EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF

SUCH DAMAGES.



  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.



  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided

above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,

reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates

an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the

Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a

copy of the Program in return for a fee.



                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS



            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs



  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest

possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it

free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.



  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest

to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively

state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least

the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.



    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>



    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify

    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by

    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or

    (at your option) any later version.



    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the

    GNU General Public License for more details.



    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License

    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.



Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.



  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short

notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:



    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.

    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it

    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.



The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate

parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands

might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".



  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,

if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.

For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see

<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.



  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program

into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you

may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with

the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General

Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read

--------------- SECTION 6: GNU Library General Public License, V2.0 -----------

		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
your libraries, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
the same as in the ordinary license.

  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
treats it as such.

  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
will lead to faster development of free libraries.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
works together with the library.

  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
General Public License rather than by this special one.

		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.
  
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Library General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!



--------------- SECTION 7: GNU Lesser General Public License, V2.1 -----------

		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2.1, February 1999

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Lesser General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!



--------------- SECTION 8: GNU Free Documentation License V1.1 -----------

		GNU Free Documentation License
		   Version 1.1, March 2000

 Copyright (C) 2000  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any
such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
addressed as "you".

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include
PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.


2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
   it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
   substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
entitled "Endorsements."


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.
Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License provided that you also include the
original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
between the translation and the original English version of this
License, the original English version will prevail.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
      Free Documentation License".

If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
"Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.



--------------- SECTION 9: GNU Free Documentation License V1.2 -----------

                GNU Free Documentation License
                  Version 1.2, November 2002


 Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.


2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
Entitled "Endorsements".


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
    Free Documentation License".

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.



--------------- SECTION 10: GNU Free Documentation License V1.3 -----------

GNU Free Documentation License

Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

Copyright (c) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure
everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or
without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily,
this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit
for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications
made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works
of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements
the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed
for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program
should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software
does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be
used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it
is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally
for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants
a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers
to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee,
and is addressed as "you". You accept the license if you copy, modify
or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications
and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook
of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The
relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject
or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical
or political position regarding them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that
says that the Document is released under this License. If a section
does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed
to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant
Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then
there are none.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be
at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with
generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint
programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that
is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a
variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in
an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup,
has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used
for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not "Transparent"
is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML
using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent
image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary
formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors,
SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced
by some word processors for output purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats
which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text
near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the
beginning of the body of the text.

The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of
the Document to the public.

A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for
a specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
meaning of this License.

2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical
measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the
copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in
exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies
you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back
cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title
with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to
the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy
these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,
you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the
actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using public
has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the
latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent
copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least
one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of
it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

    * A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
    distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
    versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History
    section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous
    version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

    * B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
    entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
    Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors
    of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than
    five), unless they release you from this requirement.

    * C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified
    Version, as the publisher.

    * D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

    * E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
    adjacent to the other copyright notices.

    * F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
    notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under
    the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

    * G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
    Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license
    notice.

    * H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

    * I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
    and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors,
    and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If
    there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
    stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
    given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
    Version as stated in the previous sentence.

    * J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
    public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
    the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
    it was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You
    may omit a network location for a work that was published at least
    four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher
    of the version it refers to gives permission.

    * K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
    Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
    the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
    and/or dedications given therein.

    * L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
    in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent
    are not considered part of the section titles.

    * M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may
    not be included in the Modified Version.

    * N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
    or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

    * O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied
from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of
these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list
of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These
titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties, for
example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved
by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover
Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements
made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text
for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by
the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another;
but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant
Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them
all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice,
and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there
are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents,
make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it,
in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that
section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment
to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license
notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" in
the various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History";
likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any
sections Entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections Entitled
"Endorsements".

6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage
or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of
the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When
the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply
to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative
works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies
of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the
entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that
bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent
of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must
appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.

8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing
Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from
their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all
Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant
Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the
license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided
that you also include the original English version of this License and
the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a
disagreement between the translation and the original version of this
License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.

9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically
terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to
notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days
after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by
some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of
violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and
you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail
to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If
the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License
"or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following
the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later
version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software
Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this
License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by
the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can
decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Document.

11. RELICENSING

"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public
wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A "Massive
Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site means any
set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license
published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation
with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as
well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same
organization.

"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in
part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this License,
and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere
other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part
into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2)
were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

    Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
    Free Documentation License".

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with ... Texts." line with this:

    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.



--------------- SECTION 11: GNU Lesser General Public License, V3.0 -----------

		   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.

3.4. Application of Additional Terms. 
You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. 

3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions. 
You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. 

3.6. Larger Works. 
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software. 

4. Versions of the License. 

4.1. New Versions. 
Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License. 

4.2. Effect of New Versions. 
You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward. 

4.3. Modified Versions. 
When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License. 

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. 
COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 

6. TERMINATION. 

6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. 

6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant. 

6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license. 

6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination. 

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. 
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. 
The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. sec. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License. 

9. MISCELLANEOUS. 
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software. 

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. 
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability. 

NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL) 
The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State of California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.



--------------- SECTION 14: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International -----------

Creative Commons Corporation (“Creative Commons”) is not a law firm and does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related information available on an “as-is” basis. Creative Commons gives no warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the fullest extent possible.

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations for the public.

Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.
Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.
Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.
Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.
Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.
Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.
Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.
Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.

License grant.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.
Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.
Downstream recipients.
Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.
No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

Other rights.
Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.

Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.

Attribution.

If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:
retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:
identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);
a copyright notice;
a notice that refers to this Public License;
a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;
indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.
You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.
If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.
If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;
if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.

The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:
automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.
Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.

Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.

Section 8 – Interpretation.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.
To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.
Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses. Notwithstanding, Creative Commons may elect to apply one of its public licenses to material it publishes and in those instances will be considered the “Licensor.” Except for the limited purpose of indicating that material is shared under a Creative Commons public license or as otherwise permitted by the Creative Commons policies published at creativecommons.org/policies, Creative Commons does not authorize the use of the trademark “Creative Commons” or any other trademark or logo of Creative Commons without its prior written consent including, without limitation, in connection with any unauthorized modifications to any of its public licenses or any other arrangements, understandings, or agreements concerning use of licensed material. For the avoidance of doubt, this paragraph does not form part of the public licenses.
